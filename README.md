# Record Chain

Record Chain is a backend Node.js-based REST API application that simulates a blockchain. The API allows creating blocks with data, listing all blocks in the chain, and retrieving a specific block by its ID.

The application is built with a focus on proof-of-work verification, test-driven development (TDD), and follows the MVC design pattern to ensure a clear and scalable architecture.

The purpose is to provide a basic blockchain solution that can be used as a template or starting point for further development of blockchain-related projects.
